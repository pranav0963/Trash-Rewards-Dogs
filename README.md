# Trash-Rewards-Dogs

“Trash Reward’s Dogs” is a kind of vending machine to the dogs where the input to this machine 
is ‘Trash’ and not ‘Cash’. Firstly, a dog has to come near to the machine, it gets sensed by an
ultrasound sensor and the lid gets opened automatically by a servo motor, just for a moment. 
Another ultrasound sensor in the bin detects whether any trash is dropped into or not. Then it 
sends a signal to a food supply that’s just beside of it and another servo motor is activate to open 
a barrier and little food comes rolling out down to the dog. Some small demonstration to few dogs 
will easily make them understand the process as they are intelligent enogh and with minimum 
human intervention this project is done.

There is a very big problem being faced by human race in today’s generation and that is ‘Trash’
in tourist places, on walkways, streets and roads. Though there are sanitation workers sweeping 
our surroundings continuously, that place still can never be clean and this is due to people littering
continuously, by not using dustbins and throwing away trash such as chocolate wrappers, chips 
packets, water bottles or plastic covers on their way. Despite of so much of awareness given by 
moments like “Swachh Bharat” and other cleaning campaigns, a person’s laziness towards 
searching a nearby dustbin has not decreased. Another major problem in the society is ‘Street 
Dogs’. In recent times, there was a case where a gang of dogs have killed a young boy and that’s 
because of hunger. Dogs are loyal animals, but that also depends on how we treat them. Dogs are 
intelligent animals and will obey to us if we provide them proper food. As a solution to both these 
major problems in our society, we have come up with this project “Trash Reward’s Dogs”.
